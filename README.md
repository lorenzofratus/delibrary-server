<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project has been developed as final assignment for the _Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications_ course held by Professor Luciano Baresi at _Politecnico di Milano_.

The objective of this project was to build a multi-platform mobile application using a framework of choice among Flutter, React Native, Kotlin, and Swift.

Delibrary is a mobile application designed to encourage the exchange of physical books.

A user can publish their own books on Delibrary, point out books they would like to own and propose exchanges to other users.
Delibrary is in charge of connecting users interested in a book exchange.

Finally, the idea is to create a _"decentralized library"_, in which readers are encouraged to immerse themselves
in ever new adventures and to be part of a community of book enthusiasts.

At the moment, Delibrary has been developed for the Italian market, for this reason, the UI is in Italian.

The frontend is a mobile application built with _Flutter_ and _Dart_.

The code of the frontend can be found at this [link](https://github.com/lorenzofratus/delibrary-server).
